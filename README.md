# zFilter

####Application to filter killmails based on user criteria. Built on top of the zKillboard API and (hopefully) the eve_nav API. 

#####Disclaimer: If a killmail is not on zKillboard it won't be here either!



###### Filters - Lets you specify what killmails show up in the feed. Changing filters does not delete or affect the killmails the application keeps track of - only determines whether or not they will be visible.
